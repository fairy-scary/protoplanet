NOTES:
-Couldn't find good redux form examples
-Used Formik bc docs were good + recomended by react docs
    -<Formik /> component is the wrapper equipped with numerous props to help build events; <Form /> is a wrapper around an HTML <form> element that is automatically hooked into Formikâ€™s handleSubmit and handleReset; <Field /> uses the name attribute to automatically hook up inputs to Formik.
    -https://formik.org/docs/tutorial#prerequisites was super helpful for explaining all the abstractions
    -dependencies: formik, yup --save

TO-DOs:
-Add validation to /createshop api route
-
