I need to just change one column of data in a seeder, but have a lot of PK references going around so don't want to unseed 

SOLUTION: Make goal to have post creation form working today!

NOTES:
-Couldn't find good redux form examples
-Used Formik bc docs were good + recomended by react docs
    -<Formik /> component is the wrapper equipped with numerous props to help build events; <Form /> is a wrapper around an HTML <form> element that is automatically hooked into Formikâ€™s handleSubmit and handleReset; <Field /> uses the name attribute to automatically hook up inputs to Formik.
-https://formik.org/docs/tutorial#prerequisites was super helpful for explaining all the abstractions
-dependencies: formik, yup --save

TO-DOs:
-Add validation to /createshop api route
-DRY up continents api route
-
